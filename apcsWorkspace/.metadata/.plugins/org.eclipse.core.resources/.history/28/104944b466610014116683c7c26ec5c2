	/**
	 * This method returns the American Soundex code for a given String name.
	 * 
	 * The Soundex code for a name consists of a letter followed by three numerical digits: 
	 * the letter is the first letter of the name, and the digits encode the remaining 
	 * consonants. Similar sounding consonants share the same digit so, for example, 
	 * the labial consonants B, F, P, and V are each encoded as the number 1.
	 *  
	 *	The correct value can be found as follows:
	 *
	 	1. Retain the first letter of the name and drop all other occurrences of 
	 *     a, e, i, o, u, y, h, w.
	    2. Replace consonants with digits as follows (after the first letter):
	 *     b, f, p, v -> 1
	 *     c, g, j, k, q, s, x, z -> 2
	 *     d, t -> 3
	 *     l -> 4
	 *     m, n -> 5
	 *     r -> 6
        3. If two or more letters with the same number are adjacent in the original 
     *     name (before step 1), only retain the first letter; also two letters with 
     *     the same number separated by 'h' or 'w' are coded as a single number, 
     *     whereas such letters separated by a vowel are coded twice. This rule also 
     *     applies to the first letter.
	    4. Iterate the previous step until you have one letter and three numbers. 
	 *     If you have too few letters in your word that you can't assign three numbers, 
	 *     append with zeros until there are three numbers. If you have more than 3 letters, 
	 *     just retain the first 3 numbers.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * @param name - a String name to be encoded using the American Soundex algorithm
	 * @return - a String soundex code
